## Music Data Trend Analysis


https://jerryguangxu.github.io/Spotify-Music-Data-Analysis/
In this project, we conducted data mining for the information of 200000 tracks over the past 20 years (10000 tracks per year). 

The information was pulled out from Spotify API and include: 
1. General numeric features (e.g. release time, popularity, artist popularity), 
2. Numeric physical properties (e.g. loudness, duration) 
3. Non-numeric ones (e.g. genres, album name, artist name)


The purposes are:
a. Analyze the trend of music development over past 20 years. 
   *For example, the track has been louder than before? Or duration is longer than before?*
b. Analyze what features are associated with popularity, and establish models to predict track popularity by machine learning    algorithms.
   *For example, is louder song more popular nowadays? *

### III. Model Selection: Random Forest Regression
1. Feature correlation

   Some features are highly correlated, for example, Sodium and Chloride concentration, 
   also ALT(SGPT) and AST(SGOT),two aminotransferases enzymes.
   Some correlated features are interesting, such as platelets count and pulse.
